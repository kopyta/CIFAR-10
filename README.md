# Enhancing Performance on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18 models

Since I do not own a device with GPU, I worked using Google Colab. Therefore, my code when not run in Google Colab environment, might require adjustments such us not mounting Google Drive and changing PATH for saving/loading the models.

If You do not wish to train the models Yourself, I provide the 5 models trained by me. To achieve the final accuracy I essembled 3 first models (with the name ending from 0 to 2). Please unzip the models and load them correctly to essemble.ipynb .

**In the LMS assignment there was no posibillity of uploading the report.** Therefore I uploaded the report to the github repository.
